=== TIPS FOR EFFECTIVE GOAL SETTING ===
"1. Limit to 3 major goals per quarter - focus beats breadth"
"2. Make goals specific and measurable - 'grow revenue' vs 'add $5K MRR'"
"3. Break goals into monthly milestones - big goals need small steps"
"4. Review weekly - adjust tactics not goals"
"5. Celebrate completions - acknowledge progress"
